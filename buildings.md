# Buildings
> [<< back to readme](README.md)

Buildings can be placed in settlements to provide services (ie. a ship hangar) or functions (ie. factories). Certain buildings will enable zoning of land (ie. farms). Buildings can be upgraded. On a world without a suitable atmosphere (or a world that hasn't been terraformed) Buildings will require canopies and so cost slightly more to build. Buildings produce pollution which affects the atmosphere (and population happiness). Buildings exist in several categories:

- Farms
- Mines (?)
- Power
- Factories
- Logistics
- Amenities
- Research
- Defence
- Special

## Farms
Farm buildings allow for areas of land to be zoned for farming. Properties of the land the farm is placed on will affect it's productiveness depending on its type (nitrites etc.). Farms can be upgraded to increase zoning area size or increase productivity. Farms are used to produce the majority of the food commodities in the game.

- Crops (choose percentage of what crop should be grown)
    - Vegetables
    - Fruits
    - Grains
- Livestock (choose allocation of animals per category)
    - Meat
    - Dairy

## Mines (?)
Mines work similarly to farms in that they allow land to be zoned for mining. The properties of the land the zone is placed on will determine what the mine produces. Most resources are not sustainable (driving exploration to more worlds and maturation of planet economy towards information etc.). There are several types of mine:

- Surface mine (all the same type of building, output depends on zoned land)
    - Iron
    - copper
    - bauxite (aluminium)
    - coal
    - uranium
    - stone
- Logging (requires trees to be present in zone, can be made sustainable for extra cost)
- Oil drilling
    - Well
    - Off shore
    - Fracking
- Water collection (rate of collection affects sustainability)

## Power
Power is required for all buildings to work. Power buildings will power other buildings within a radius (in the same settlement). Power distributers increase this range.

- Low pollution (requires land, more resources)
    - Wind
    - Solar
    - Nuclear
    - Fusion (end game)
- High pollution (easy setup)
    - Oil
    - Coal

## Factories
Factories process raw commodities into processed commodities or goods. Their output depends on the input from mines or trading.

- Processing (inputs determine output, ie. 50% iron 50% copper into sheet factory produces the proportion output)
    - Sheet (iron, aluminium, steel)
    - Girder (iron, aluminium, steel)
    - Wire (copper)
    - Steel (iron+coal)
    - Plastics (oil)
    - Carbon Fibre (coal)
- Production
    - Circuits (wire+iron sheet)
    - Ship module parts
    - Tech
    - Weapon parts

## Logistics
While buildings have a small range to send/receive items and power, logistics buildings are required to distribute commodities/goods/power accross greater distances/between settlements. Storage buildings are also required to store resources.

- Store (store any item -**buildings** and **ships**)
- Power distributer (both sends/receives)
- Ground freight (low range)
- Air freight (greater range)

## Amenities
Amenity buildings cover a wide range of different buildings catering to the needs of the inhabitants of the settlements. Expedition buildings are used when initially founding a settlement.

- Expedition buildings (initial settlement)
    - HAB (first building for a settlement)
    - RTG (power generator)
    - > TODO add more
- Livability (quality affects settlement happiness)
    - housing
    - restaurants
    - cinemas
    - city hall
    - > TODO add more
- Transport
    - space (increase population)
    - air
    - metro

## Research
Research is used to unlock buildings and upgrades (a small amount of research can be carried with when settling a new world). Software produces money and a small amount of research.

- Labs
- University
- Software company

## Defence
Some worlds will have alien populations. If the player is hostile to them (can earn money/resources) or they are hostile to the player, defence buildings may be required to fend off attacks.

- Walls
- Turrets (unmanned)
- Barracks (manned)

## Special
Special buildings provide extra functions to settlements.

- spaceship factory (lategame alternative to buying ships)
- spaceship hangar (store multiple ships)
- trading port
