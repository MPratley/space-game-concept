# Buildings
Buildings can be placed in settlements to provide services (ie. a ship hangar) or functions (ie. factories). Certain buildings will enable zoning of land (ie. farms). Buildings exist in several categories:

- Farms
- Mines
- Utility
- Amenities
- Factories
- Power
- Research
- Defence
- Terraforming
