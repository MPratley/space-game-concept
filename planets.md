# Planets
A random number of planets is allocated to each star system. When generated planets have various properties, including atmosphere, resources and existing population. Planets are procedurally generated when a player enters the system. Settlements can be placed in locations on the planet, taking up space and exerting influence over the planet/system.

## Terrain
Terrain is procedurally generated. This is inspired by an image from [Arvi "Hempuli" Teikari's blog:](https://www.hempuli.com/blogblog/archives/186)
